/*

  This macro will add histograms from a list of root files and write them
  to a target root file. The target file is newly created and must not be
  identical to one of the source files.

  Syntax:

  hist_add targetfile source1 source2 ...

  Author: Sven A. Schmidt, sven.schmidt@cern.ch
  Date:   13.2.2001

  This code is based on the hadd.C example by Rene Brun and Dirk Geppert,
  which had a problem with directories more than one level deep.

  I have tested this macro on rootfiles with one and two dimensional 
  histograms, and two levels of subdirectories. Feel free to send comments 
  or bug reports to me.
